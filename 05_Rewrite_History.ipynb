    "\n",
    "The `git commit --amend` command is a convenient way to **modify the most recent commit**. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to **simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot**. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it **replaces it entirely**, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. To Git, it will look like **a brand new commit**.\n",

    "## Change older or multiple commits (`git rebase`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebase is one of two Git utilities that specializes in integrating changes from one branch onto another. The other change integration utility is `git merge`. Merge is always a forward moving change record. Alternatively, rebase has powerful history rewriting features. Rebase itself has 2 main modes: \"**manual**\" and \"**interactive**\" mode. We will cover the different Rebase modes in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rebasing is the process of **moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit**. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a content perspective, rebasing is changing the base of your branch from one commit to another making it appear as if you'd created your branch from a different commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, Git accomplishes this by creating new commits and applying them to the specified base. It's very important to understand that **even though the branch looks the same, it's composed of entirely new commits**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason for rebasing is to maintain a linear project history. For example, consider a situation where the master branch has progressed since you started working on a feature branch. You want to get the latest updates to the master branch in your feature branch, but you want to keep your branch's history clean so it appears as if you've been working off the latest master branch. This gives the later benefit of a **clean merge** of your feature branch back into the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options for integrating your feature into the master branch: **merging directly** or **rebasing and then merging**. The former option results in a **3-way merge** and a **merge commit**, while the latter results in a **fast-forward merge** and a perfectly **linear history**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should **never rebase commits once they've been pushed to a public repository**. The rebase would replace the old commits with new ones and it would look like that part of your project history abruptly vanished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are in a feature branch, running\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rebase master\n",
    "```\n",
    "will rebase all commits in feature onto the **local version** of master.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we run\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rebase master feature2\n",
    "```\n",
    "and it is equivalent to\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout feature2\n",
    "git rebase master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to run rebase with `-i` or `--interactive`. This will prompt up the history of commits that are going to be rebased in a text editor, and we can choose whether to **pick** a commit or to **squash** it, meaning that commit will be absorbed into the next commit. This is how `git rebase` makes the commit history cleaner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In complicated cases like `next` branched off from `master`, and we have a `feature` based on branch `next`, running\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git rebase --onto master next feature\n",
    "```\n",
    "will rebase `feature` onto `master` such that it appears to be made on top of `master` from the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat to consider when working with Git Rebase is **merge conflicts** may become more frequent during a rebase workflow. This occurs if you have a long-lived branch that has strayed from master. Eventually you will want to rebase against master and at that time it may contain many new commits that your branch changes may conflict with. This is easily remedied by rebasing your branch frequently against master, and making more frequent commits. The `--continue` and `--abort` command line arguments can be passed to git rebase to advance or reset the the rebase when dealing with conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more serious rebase caveat is **lost commits from interactive history rewriting**. Running rebase in interactive mode and executing subcommands like squash or drop will remove commits from your branche's immediate log. At first glance this can appear as though the commits are permanently gone. Using git reflog these commits can be restored and the entire rebase can be undone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git Rebase itself is not seriously dangerous. The real danger cases arise when **executing history rewriting interactive rebases and force pushing the results to a remote branch that's shared by other users**. This is a pattern that should be avoided as it has the capability to overwrite other remote users' work when they pull."
