    "The point is, your development should always take place on a branch—never on a detached HEAD. This makes sure you always have a reference to your new commits. However, if you’re just looking at an old commit, it doesn’t really matter if you’re in a detached HEAD state or not.\n",

In a detached state, any new commits you make will be orphaned when you change branches back to an established branch. **Orphaned commits are up for deletion by Git's garbage collector**. The garbage collector runs on a configured interval and permanently destroys orphaned commits. To prevent orphaned commits from being garbage collected, we need to ensure we are on a branch.\n",

The three arguments each correspond to Git's **three internal state management mechanism's**, The **Commit Tree** (**HEAD**), The **Staging Index**, and The **Working Directory**. It is sometimes called Git's \"**three trees**\". `--soft` only operates on the _Commit History_, `--mixed` operates on _both the Commit History and the Staged Snapshot_ and `--hard` operates on _all three tress_.\n",
    "\n",

It will update the **ref pointers** to the specific commit, and **reset the Staging Index and Working Direcotry** to match that specific commit as well.

This data loss cannot be undone, this is critical to take note of.\n",

    "Whereas `git revert` is designed to safely undo a public commit, `git reset` is designed to undo local changes to the Staging Index and Working Directory. Because of their distinct goals, the two commands are implemented differently: resetting completely removes a changeset, whereas reverting maintains the original changeset and uses a new commit to apply the undo.\n",
