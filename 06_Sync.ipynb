    "The git remote command lets you create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Remote connections are more like **bookmarks** rather than direct links into other repositories. Instead of providing real-time access to another repository, they serve as convenient names that can be used to reference a not-so-convenient URL.\n",

This is useful for developers creating a **local copy** of a central repository, since it provides an easy way to pull upstream changes or publish local commits. This behavior is also why most Git-based projects call their central repository origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we just pushed to or pulled from `origin`. `git log` will show that `HEAD`, `origin/master`, `origin/HEAD` are pointing to the same commit, the most recent one.

    "The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on. It’s similar to svn update in that it lets you see how the central history has progressed, but **it doesn’t force you to actually merge the changes** into your repository. Fetched content has to be explicitly checked out using the `git checkout` command. This makes fetching a **safe** way to review commits before integrating them with your local repository. On the other hand, `git pull` is the more **aggressive** alternative, it will download the remote content for the active local branch and immediately execute `git merge` to **create a merge commit** for the new remote content. If you have pending changes in progress this will cause **conflicts** and kickoff the merge conflict resolution flow.\n",

The only time you should ever need to force push is when you realize that the commits you just shared were not quite right and you fixed them with a **`git commit --amend`** or an **interactive rebase**. Once a commit is amended a `git push` will fail because Git will see the amended commit and the remote commit as **diverged content**. The `--force` option must be used to push an amended commit. However, you must be absolutely certain that none of your teammates have pulled those commits before using the `--force` option.\n",
