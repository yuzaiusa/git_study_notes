    "## The three trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Git has three internal state management mechanisms, \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The Working Directory (**Working copy**), \n",
    "+ The Staging Index (**Index**), \n",
    "+ and The Commit Tree (**HEAD**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first tree is \"**The Working Directory**\". This tree is in sync with the **local filesystem** and is representative of the immediate changes made to content in files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up is the '**Staging Index**' tree. This tree is tracking Working Directory changes, that have been **promoted** with `git add`, to be stored in the next commit. This tree is a complex internal caching mechanism. Git generally tries to hide the implementation details of the Staging Index from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accurately view the state of the Staging Index we must utilize a lesser known Git command `git ls-files --stage`. The `git ls-files --stage` command is essentially a debug utility for inspecting the state of the Staging Index tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final tree is the **Commit History**. The `git commit` command adds changes to a permanent snapshot that lives in the Commit History. This snapshot also includes the state of the Staging Index at the time of commit."
